Dear Anna,
I wanted to discuss the progress of the website design project. While I appreciate the effort you've put in so far, I've noticed that we are falling behind on our agreed-upon deadlines. As the project manager, it's important that I make sure everyone is on track and that we're meeting our goals.
Can you let me know what might be causing the delays? Are there any particular challenges that you're facing? I want to understand the root of the problem so that we can work together to find a solution.
Going forward, I need you to commit to a specific timeline for completing each task, and communicate with me if you anticipate any delays. We need to make sure we're hitting our milestones so that we can launch the new website on time.
I'm confident that we can work together to get back on track and deliver a successful website. Let's schedule a meeting to discuss this further and come up with a plan to move forward.
Thank you for your hard work so far, and I look forward to hearing from you.
Best, Artem!
